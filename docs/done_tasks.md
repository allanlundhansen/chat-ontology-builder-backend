## Completed: Implement DELETE /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}

*(Archived on: Current Date)*

### Focus: Concept DELETE Endpoint

**Goal:** Add functionality to delete a concept by its element ID.

### Tasks:

-   [x] **API Endpoint (`concepts.py`):**
    -   [x] Define `delete_concept_by_element_id(element_id: str, session: AsyncSession)` function.
    -   [x] Add `@router.delete("/{element_id}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)` decorator.
    -   [x] Implement Cypher query: `MATCH (c) WHERE elementId(c) = $element_id DETACH DELETE c RETURN count(c)`.
    -   [x] Execute query using `session.run()`.
    -   [x] Check query result (count of deleted nodes).
    -   [x] Raise `HTTPException` (404 Not Found) if count is 0.
    -   [x] Ensure `204 No Content` is returned on success (handled by decorator).
-   [x] **Integration Test (`test_concept_endpoints.py`):**
    -   [x] Create `test_delete_concept_success()`:
        -   [x] Arrange: Create a concept via POST.
        -   [x] Act: Call DELETE on the new concept's ID.
        -   [x] Assert: Check for 204 status.
        -   [x] Act (Verify): Call GET on the deleted concept's ID.
        -   [x] Assert (Verify): Check for 404 status.
    -   [x] Create `test_delete_concept_not_found()`:
        -   [x] Arrange: Define a non-existent element ID.
        -   [x] Act: Call DELETE on the non-existent ID.
        -   [x] Assert: Check for 404 status.
-   [x] **Documentation:**
    -   [x] Update this file (`current_tasks.md`) upon completion.
    -   [x] Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` after the feature is fully implemented and tested.

### Notes/Considerations:
- Remember `DETACH DELETE` to handle relationships.
- Ensure async/await is used correctly in tests and endpoint.
