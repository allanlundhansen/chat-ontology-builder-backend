# Neural-Symbolic Bridge (Phase 1) - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing the first phase of the Neural-Symbolic Bridge, creating a foundational system that translates between neural network representations (embeddings) and symbolic knowledge graph structures. In this initial phase, we will focus on establishing the core framework for bidirectional translation, with an emphasis on connecting the Action/Sense Layer's LLM outputs to the Understanding Module's categorical structure.

## 2. Problem Statement

The KantAI backend requires a mechanism to bridge the gap between neural representations (such as embeddings from LLMs) and symbolic representations (such as concepts and relationships in the knowledge graph). Without this bridge, the system cannot effectively translate unstructured information into structured knowledge that conforms to the Kantian framework, nor can it leverage the knowledge graph to guide neural processing. We need a robust neural-symbolic interface that enables bidirectional translation while maintaining philosophical integrity.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Create a foundational Neural-Symbolic Bridge connecting LLM outputs to knowledge graph structures
- Implement basic Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) for translating between embeddings and symbolic predicates
- Develop schematism mechanisms that map sensory patterns to categorical structures
- Support bidirectional translation (neural→symbolic and symbolic→neural)
- Enable confidence-weighted translations that reflect uncertainty
- Lay the groundwork for future Graph Neural Network (GNN) capabilities
- Establish an extensible framework for further neural-symbolic integration

## 4. User Stories

- As a developer of the Action/Sense Layer, I want to translate LLM outputs into symbolic structures compatible with the knowledge graph
- As a knowledge engineer, I want to translate semantic queries into neural embeddings for similarity search
- As a system architect, I want bidirectional translation between embeddings and symbolic structures
- As an AI researcher, I want to associate confidence scores with neural-symbolic translations
- As an integrator, I want a clean API for neural-symbolic translations that other modules can use
- As a domain expert, I want to trace how neural representations map to symbolic knowledge
