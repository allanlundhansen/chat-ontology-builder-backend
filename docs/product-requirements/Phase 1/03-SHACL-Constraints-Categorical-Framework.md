# SHACL Constraints for Categorical Framework - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project focuses on implementing SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) constraints for the Kantian categorical framework established in the Neo4j knowledge graph. These constraints will enforce the logical and structural rules derived from Kant's epistemology, ensuring that all data in the graph conforms to the categorical requirements.

## 2. Problem Statement

The Kantian categorical structure implemented in our knowledge graph requires formal validation mechanisms to maintain its philosophical integrity. Without proper constraints, the system could accumulate data that violates Kantian principles, leading to logical inconsistencies and erroneous reasoning. SHACL constraints are needed to enforce categorical rules, validate relationships, and maintain ontological coherence across the system.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Implement SHACL constraints that enforce Kantian categorical rules
- Validate all node and relationship creations against these constraints
- Ensure existing data conforms to the categorical framework
- Provide meaningful error messages when constraint violations occur
- Support the Evans' input/output logic formalism described in the architecture

## 4. User Stories

- As a knowledge engineer, I want constraints that prevent me from creating logically inconsistent relationships between concepts
- As a developer, I want automatic validation of new concept data against Kantian rules
- As a system architect, I want to ensure that no data in the system violates the categorical framework
- As an AI researcher, I want clear error messages when attempting to add data that doesn't conform to Kantian categories
- As a data curator, I want to validate the entire knowledge graph against categorical constraints to identify issues

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Category Constraints

- Implement constraints that enforce the proper structure of the four main categories
- Create SHACL shapes that validate the relationships between categories and subcategories
- Ensure each category contains only its specified subdivisions
- Validate properties required for each category type

### 5.2 Concept Node Constraints

- Create constraints that validate concept properties (ID, name, confidence score, etc.)
- Implement constraints ensuring concepts properly connect to at least one categorical classification
- Validate that stability status is properly set (ephemeral or stable)
- Ensure confidence scores are within valid ranges (0-1)

### 5.3 Relationship Constraints

- Implement constraints for each relationship type that enforce appropriate source and target node types:
  - INSTANCE_OF: Valid only between concepts and categories
  - HAS_PROPERTY: Valid only for substance-accident relationships
  - CAUSES: Valid only for causal relationships between concepts
  - INTERACTS_WITH: Valid only for community relationships
  - CONTAINS: Valid only for totality relationships
  - IS_PART_OF: Valid only for plurality relationships
- Create constraints that validate relationship properties
- Implement transitivity and other logical constraints for appropriate relationships

### 5.4 Evans' Input/Output Logic Constraints

- Implement SHACL constraints that enforce Evans' formalization of Kant's rules
- Create validation for conditional imperatives that mandate specific operations
- Implement constraints for conditional permissives that enable optional operations
- Ensure proper distinctions between rule types are maintained in the graph structure

### 5.5 Validation Capabilities

- Implement validation functions that check new data against all constraints
- Create batch validation capabilities for the entire graph
- Develop targeted validation for specific subgraphs or concept domains
- Generate detailed validation reports that identify constraint violations

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Performance

- Optimize constraint validation to minimize impact on write operations
- Implement efficient batch validation processes for large-scale data operations
- Consider incremental validation approaches for performance-critical operations
- Evaluate constraint complexity against performance requirements

### 6.2 Integration Requirements

- Ensure SHACL constraints integrate properly with Neo4j
- Support integration with the API layer for proper error handling and validation feedback
- Consider external SHACL validation tools if Neo4j-native constraints are insufficient
- Maintain compatibility with the concept transition pipeline

### 6.3 Implementation Approach

- Determine whether to use Neo4j's native constraint mechanisms or external SHACL tools
- Consider approaches for constraint enforcement (pre-validation vs. post-validation)
- Define strategies for handling existing data that violates new constraints
- Plan for constraint versioning and evolution

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- All Kantian categorical rules are properly encoded as SHACL constraints
- New data added to the graph is automatically validated against constraints
- Constraint violations generate clear, actionable error messages
- The entire knowledge graph can be validated against all constraints
- Evans' input/output logic formalism is properly implemented in the constraints
- Performance impact of constraint validation is within acceptable limits
- Documentation of all constraints is complete and clear

## 8. Future Considerations (v2)

- Machine learning approaches to suggest constraint fixes
- Advanced logical constraints for specific knowledge domains
- Dynamic constraint generation based on concept evolution
- Extension of constraints to handle more complex philosophical implications
- Performance optimizations for constraint checking at scale
