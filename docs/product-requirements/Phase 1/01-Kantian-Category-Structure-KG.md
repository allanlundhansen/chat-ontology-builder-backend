# Kantian Category Structure Knowledge Graph - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing the core Neo4j knowledge graph schema based on Kant's categorical framework. This schema will serve as the foundation for the Understanding Module, providing a structured organization of knowledge according to the four primary Kantian categories: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Modality. In Kant's epistemology, these categories represent the fundamental concepts that structure experience, distinct from both the formal structures of General Logic and empirical concepts derived from experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

The KantAI backend requires a robust, philosophically grounded knowledge representation that can organize concepts according to Kant's epistemological framework. Current knowledge graph approaches lack the specific categorical structure needed to implement a truly Kantian cognitive architecture. We need to create a Neo4j schema that faithfully represents Kant's categories and their subdivisions while enabling efficient storage and retrieval of knowledge, maintaining proper distinction between the categorical framework (Understanding) and formal logical structures (General Logic).

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Create a Neo4j database schema that implements Kant's categorical framework
- Define node types, edge types, and properties that represent the four main categories and their subdivisions
- Establish clear boundaries between categories of Understanding and formal structures of General Logic
- Enable efficient querying and traversal of the knowledge graph
- Support the future implementation of SHACL constraints
- Establish the foundation for the Understanding Module of the KantAI architecture
- Create appropriate interfaces for organizing empirical concepts through the categorical framework

## 4. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to store concepts according to their categorical type so that the system can reason about them in a Kantian framework
- As a knowledge engineer, I want to create relationships between concepts that reflect Kantian categories like causality and substance-accident
- As a system architect, I want a knowledge graph structure that can scale as the system ingests new information
- As an AI researcher, I want to query the knowledge graph to analyze how concepts are organized within the Kantian framework

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Category Node Structure

- Implement four top-level category nodes: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Modality
- For each category, implement the three subdivisions as defined by Kant:
  - Quantity: Unity, Plurality, Totality
  - Quality: Reality, Negation, Limitation
  - Relation: Substance-Accident, Causality, Community
  - Modality: Possibility/Impossibility, Existence/Non-existence, Necessity/Contingency
- Define properties for each category type, including:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Formal definition
  - Examples

### 5.2 Concept Node Structure

- Implement a generic Concept node type with properties:
  - ID
  - Name
  - Description
  - Creation timestamp
  - Confidence score
  - Stability status (ephemeral or stable)
  - Source information
- Enable concepts to be tagged with multiple categorical classifications
- Support both primitive and complex concepts

### 5.3 Relationship Types

- Implement relationship types corresponding to Kantian categories:
  - INSTANCE_OF: Connects concepts to their categorical classification
  - HAS_PROPERTY: Implements Substance-Accident relationships
  - CAUSES: Implements Causality relationships
  - INTERACTS_WITH: Implements Community (reciprocal) relationships
  - CONTAINS: Implements Totality relationships
  - IS_PART_OF: Implements Plurality relationships
- Each relationship should have properties:
  - Confidence score
  - Creation timestamp
  - Source information
  - Temporal qualifiers (if applicable)

### 5.4 Query Capabilities

- Create Cypher queries to retrieve concepts by category
- Implement queries to navigate causal chains
- Support queries that filter by confidence thresholds
- Enable retrieval of all categorical relationships for a given concept

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Performance

- Implement appropriate indices for efficient retrieval of concepts by category
- Optimize graph structure for traversal of categorical relationships
- Consider partitioning strategies for scaling as the knowledge base grows
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed categorical structures

### 6.2 Integration Requirements

- Design the schema to support future SHACL constraints
- Ensure compatibility with Logic Tensor Networks for the neural-symbolic bridge
- Create clear interfaces with the General Logic Module while maintaining proper boundaries
- Prepare for integration with the Action/Sense Layer
- Consider serialization formats for API responses
- Establish patterns for how empirical concepts are organized through the categories

### 6.3 Data Storage

- Design efficient property structures that minimize redundancy
- Implement appropriate data types for confidence scores and timestamps
- Consider compression strategies for description fields
- Plan for backup and recovery procedures

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- The Neo4j database successfully implements all four Kantian categories and their subdivisions
- The system maintains proper philosophical distinction between categories (Understanding) and formal logical structures (General Logic)
- Concept nodes can be created and classified according to the categorical framework
- All relationship types are implemented and can be created between concepts
- Basic queries can retrieve concepts by category and navigate relationships
- The schema accommodates both simple and complex concepts
- Documentation of the schema is complete and clear, including proper explanation of Kantian distinctions
- Sample data demonstrating the categorical structure is provided

## 8. Future Considerations (v2)

- Integration with external ontologies and knowledge bases
- Versioning system for evolving concepts
- Support for multi-language concept representations
- Reasoning capabilities directly within the graph database
- Performance optimizations for large-scale knowledge representation
