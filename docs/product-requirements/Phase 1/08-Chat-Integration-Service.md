# Chat Integration Service - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing a Chat Integration Service that serves as a dedicated interface between the Chat Ontology Builder frontend and the KantAI backend. This service will enable users to interact with the knowledge graph through natural language conversations, query the ontology, receive explanations based on the Kantian framework, and make changes to the ontology structure in an intuitive manner. The service is designed to be implemented early in the development cycle to support compelling investor demonstrations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Users need an intuitive way to interact with complex knowledge graphs without requiring expertise in query languages or deep understanding of the underlying Kantian categorical framework. Traditional interfaces for ontology manipulation are often technical and unintuitive, creating a barrier to adoption for non-technical users. Additionally, early stakeholder and investor demonstrations require a visually compelling and interactive way to showcase the system's capabilities. We need a dedicated Chat Integration Service that bridges the frontend chat interface with the backend systems while providing natural language understanding, explanation generation, and contextualized responses based on the Kantian knowledge structure.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Create a dedicated service that interfaces between the frontend chat and backend components
- Implement natural language understanding for ontology-related queries and commands
- Enable querying, creation, modification, and exploration of the knowledge graph through conversation
- Generate natural language explanations of ontological structures and Kantian reasoning
- Support contextual conversations with history management and state tracking
- Implement real-time communication channels for responsive chat experience
- Provide visually compelling demonstrations for early stakeholder presentations
- Create an abstraction layer that simplifies integration between frontend and backend components
- Support progressive disclosure of system capabilities based on user expertise
- Ensure consistent response formatting and error handling

## 4. User Stories
