# General Logic Module with Input/Output Logic Formalism - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing the General Logic Module, which encapsulates Kant's table of judgments through Evans' input/output logic formalism. This module provides the foundational logical structures that govern valid inference independent of content within the KantAI system. Rather than using traditional truth-functional logic, this module implements judgment forms as conditional imperatives and permissives that guide cognitive operations. In accordance with Kant's epistemology, this module focuses strictly on the formal structure of thought, distinct from both the categories of the Understanding Module and the empirical concepts derived from experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

The KantAI backend requires a logical foundation that properly captures Kant's general logicâ€”the formal structure of thought independent of content. Traditional truth-functional logic is inadequate for representing Kant's system, which involves rules that guide mental operations rather than simply establish truth values. Following Evans' (2017) groundbreaking formalization, we need to implement an input/output logic system where rules are represented as ordered pairs with context-sensitive application. Without this module, the system would lack the formal logical infrastructure needed to properly implement Kantian judgment forms and reasoning patterns.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Implement the 12 forms of judgment from Kant's table using Evans' input/output logic formalism
- Create a clear distinction between imperative rules (mandatory operations) and permissive rules (optional operations)
- Establish clear boundaries between General Logic (formal structures), Categories (Understanding), and Empirical Concepts
- Develop representation of formal judgment forms in Neo4j as a foundation for future inference capabilities
- Integrate the logical formalism with the Neo4j knowledge graph
- Implement all four judgment groups: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Modality
- Support the transformation from traditional logic to operation-guiding imperatives
- Create structural foundations for future rule conflict resolution and inference capabilities

## 4. User Stories

- As a knowledge engineer, I want to represent Kantian judgment forms in the system so that reasoning follows proper logical forms
- As a developer, I want to understand the distinct roles of General Logic and the Understanding Module when modeling concepts
- As a system architect, I want the logical formalism to integrate with Neo4j so that rules can be stored and retrieved from the graph database
- As an AI researcher, I want to see how traditional logic is transformed into operation-guiding imperatives
- As a domain expert, I want to see how formal judgment structures will eventually support context-sensitive rule application
- As a frontend developer, I want to visualize and explain judgment forms through the chat interface

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Kantian Epistemological Distinctions

- Enable proper attribution of which layer a particular element belongs to
- Implement validation to ensure elements are not misclassified across layers
