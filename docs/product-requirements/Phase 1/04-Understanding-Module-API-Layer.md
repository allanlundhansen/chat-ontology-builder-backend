# Understanding Module API Layer - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves creating a comprehensive RESTful API layer that exposes the functionality of the Understanding Module, allowing other system components and the frontend Chat Ontology Builder to interact with the Kantian categorical knowledge graph. The API will provide endpoints for querying, creating, updating, and deleting concepts and relationships while enforcing the categorical constraints, as well as specialized endpoints for visualization and hierarchical data access.

## 2. Problem Statement

The KantAI backend requires a standardized interface through which other modules (Judgment, Reason, Action/Sense) and the frontend visualization tool can interact with the Understanding Module's knowledge graph. Without a well-designed API, integration between system components would be ad-hoc and inconsistent, leading to maintenance challenges and potential errors in knowledge representation. Additionally, the frontend requires efficient data retrieval for visualization and interactive editing of the ontology. We need a robust API that encapsulates the complexity of the Kantian knowledge graph while providing intuitive access to its capabilities and supporting the specific needs of ontology visualization and manipulation.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Create a RESTful API that provides access to the Understanding Module's knowledge graph
- Design endpoints that align with the Kantian categorical framework
- Implement comprehensive query capabilities for traversing relationships
- Support CRUD operations for concepts and relationships
- Ensure all API operations respect SHACL constraints
- Provide clear documentation and error handling
- Enable efficient integration with other system components
- Support visualization-specific data retrieval for the frontend
- Implement hierarchical data access for parent-child relationships
- Enable real-time validation for frontend editing operations
- Support batch operations for efficient frontend updates
