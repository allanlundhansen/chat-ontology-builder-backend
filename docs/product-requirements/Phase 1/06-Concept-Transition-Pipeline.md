# Concept Transition Pipeline - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This project involves implementing the Concept Transition Pipeline, which governs how ephemeral concepts (temporarily extracted or hypothesized) transition to stable concepts (trusted knowledge) in the system. Based on Bayesian principles, this pipeline ensures that only concepts with sufficient evidence, consistency, and categorical coherence become permanent parts of the knowledge graph.

## 2. Problem Statement

The KantAI backend needs a principled mechanism to distinguish between tentative knowledge (extracted from external sources or initially hypothesized) and verified, stable knowledge. Without this transition mechanism, the system would either be too conservative (rejecting potentially valid concepts) or too liberal (accepting unreliable information). We need a robust Bayesian framework that evaluates multiple criteria before promoting concepts to stable status, ensuring both flexibility to incorporate new information and rigor to maintain knowledge integrity.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- Implement a Bayesian framework for concept stabilization based on multiple criteria
- Create mechanisms to track confidence scores and update them with new evidence
- Develop categorical coherence measurements to ensure concepts align with the Kantian framework
- Implement temporal consistency tracking over multiple observations
- Create dynamic thresholding based on category type and impact
- Support both automated and human-in-the-loop validation processes
- Integrate with the Understanding Module and Action/Sense Layer

## 4. User Stories

- As a knowledge engineer, I want confidence scores automatically updated when new evidence confirms a concept
- As a data curator, I want to see which concepts are approaching stability threshold to prioritize validation
- As a system architect, I want different stability criteria for different types of categorical relationships
- As a developer, I want to trace the evidential history that led to a concept's stabilization
- As a researcher, I want to adjust stability thresholds for experimental knowledge domains
- As a domain expert, I want to manually review and approve concepts before final stabilization in critical areas
