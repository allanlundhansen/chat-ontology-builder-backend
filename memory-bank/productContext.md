# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Current AI systems face several critical limitations:

1. **Black Box Opacity**: Deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but lack interpretability
2. **Limited Symbolic Reasoning**: Neural networks struggle with logical reasoning and explicit rule-following
3. **Unstructured Data Processing**: Difficulty in transitioning between unstructured data and structured knowledge representations
4. **Ethical Alignment**: Most AI systems lack built-in ethical constraints and oversight
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Challenges in maintaining a consistent and evolving knowledge representation
6. **Concept Formation**: Limited ability to form new concepts dynamically in response to novel inputs

## Solution

The KantAI Backend addresses these challenges by implementing a Kantian-inspired cognitive architecture that:

1. **Integrates Neural and Symbolic Approaches**: Combines the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI
2. **Provides a Principled Framework**: Uses Kant's epistemological insights to organize knowledge according to categorical structures
3. **Bridges Raw Data and Concepts**: Implements Kant's productive and reproductive imagination as computational mechanisms to transition between unstructured data and structured concepts
4. **Enforces Ethical Constraints**: Incorporates deontological ethics throughout the decision-making process
5. **Ensures Global Coherence**: Uses active inference to maintain consistency across the knowledge graph
6. **Enables Dynamic Concept Formation**: Allows for the creation of new concepts through reflective judgment when encountering novel inputs

## User Experience Goals

The system aims to provide:

1. **Intuitive Knowledge Exploration**: Through integration with the Chat Ontology Builder frontend
2. **Natural Language Interaction**: Via a conversational interface for both technical and non-technical users
3. **Transparent Reasoning**: Clear explanations of the system's decision-making process
4. **Adaptive Knowledge Management**: Dynamic updating of the knowledge graph based on new information
5. **Ethical Decision Support**: Guidance based on principled ethical considerations
6. **Multi-modal Interaction**: Support for both visual (graph-based) and textual (chat-based) interactions

## Target Users

1. **Researchers**: Who need a system that can integrate knowledge across domains and form new concepts
2. **Knowledge Workers**: Who need to organize, explore, and interact with complex knowledge structures
3. **Data Analysts**: Who need to extract structured insights from unstructured data sources
4. **Decision Makers**: Who need ethical guidance and transparent reasoning in complex situations
5. **Domain Experts**: Who want to interact with AI systems without extensive technical knowledge
