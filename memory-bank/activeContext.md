# Active Context - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: (Current Date)*

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus remains on implementing the foundational **Phase 1** requirements outlined in `01-Kantian-Category-Structure-KG.md`. Specifically, we are building out the **API layer** using FastAPI and ensuring interactions with the Neo4j database are correct and tested. We just completed the basic CRUD operations for the Concepts endpoint.

### API Layer
- **Concepts Endpoint (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `PATCH /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
- **Relationships Endpoint (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /`: **Next Up**
  - `GET /{element_id}`: **Next Up**
  - `PUT / PATCH /{element_id}`: **Next Up**
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: **Next Up**
- **Categories Endpoint (`/api/v1/categories`)**: Not started.

### Database Layer (Neo4j)
- Core schema based on Kantian categories exists.
- Queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete, Update) on concepts are implemented.
- Query for creating relationships implemented.
- Indexing is partially implemented.

### Testing
- Integration tests for Concept CRUD (`POST`, `GET /`, `GET /{id}`, `DELETE /{id}`, `PATCH /{id}`) are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for `POST /relationships` are implemented and passing.
- Unit tests for specific validation logic exist.
- Test fixtures for Neo4j sessions (async) are set up and `conftest.py` path issues resolved.

## Recent Changes

- **Implemented `PATCH /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to partially update a concept. Uses `ConceptUpdate` model with optional fields and `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`. Uses `SET c += $update_data` Cypher clause. Returns updated concept. Handles 404 and 200 responses. Added integration tests (`test_update_concept_partial_success`, `test_update_concept_not_found`). Debugged and fixed issues related to `elementId`/`element_id` key consistency between Cypher, Pydantic models, and dictionary creation.
- **Resolved Test Setup Issues**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` by correcting `sys.path` in `conftest.py` and removing faulty enum imports from `models/concept.py`. Fixed `NameError` for `PROJECT_ROOT` in `conftest.py`.
- **Implemented `DELETE /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to delete a concept. Added integration tests.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/concepts` & `GET /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoints**: Added retrieval functionality with tests.
- **Resolved Previous Test Failures**: Addressed `FixtureLookupError`, multiple `AssertionErrors`, and `RuntimeError`.
- **Updated Documentation**: Introduced `docs/current_tasks.md`, `docs/icebox.md`, `docs/done_tasks.md` for task tracking.

## Open Questions & Decisions

- **Skipped Tests**: Prioritize addressing skipped tests? (e.g., tests requiring specific known element IDs, `test_list_concepts_empty`).
- **Error Handling**: Refine error handling and response formats for consistency across endpoints.
- **INSTANCE_OF Relationship**: How should this be managed via the API?
- **API Naming Convention**: Task created in `icebox.md` to enforce consistent `snake_case` in JSON responses. Current endpoints return `elementId`.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1.  **Commit Changes**: Commit the implemented PATCH endpoint, tests, and documentation updates (`current_tasks.md`, `done_tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2.  **Decide Next API Task**: Choose between starting Relationship CRUD (GET), addressing skipped tests, or addressing an `icebox.md` item.

### API Layer
- Implement `GET`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` endpoints for relationships.
- Implement endpoints for categories.

### Database Layer
- Implement Cypher queries for Relationship GET/UPDATE/DELETE operations.
- Implement queries for managing `INSTANCE_OF` relationships.
- Develop queries for navigating semantic, temporal, and spatial relationships as per PRD Task 4.

### Testing
- Add integration tests for remaining Relationship CRUD and Category endpoints.
- Address skipped tests.
- Potentially add more unit tests for complex business logic if needed.

### Documentation
- Continue updating Memory Bank files as progress is made.
- Generate/update OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
- Document schema and queries more formally (PRD Task 5).
- Address items in `icebox.md` when prioritized.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Direct Neo4j Implementation**: Decided to implement the Knowledge Graph directly in Neo4j with Cypher scripts rather than using a Python abstraction layer to minimize unnecessary complexity
2. **Cypher Query Approach**: Chose to use direct Cypher queries instead of GraphQL, focusing on leveraging Neo4j's native query capabilities
3. **Query Templates**: Decided to define reusable query templates in `.cypher` files. These will be loaded and executed by the application layer, as APOC procedures (`apoc.custom.asProcedure`) are not available in the current AuraDB environment.
4. **Modality Representation Strategy**: Decided to replace the Phase 1 property-based modality on Concept nodes with a judgment-based representation in Phase 2, rather than maintaining coexistence. This involves a planned migration.
5. **Quality/Modality Value Validation**: Due to limitations with Neo4j 5.x constraint syntax and the unavailability of APOC triggers in the current AuraDB environment, the validation ensuring `quality` and `modality` properties contain only the allowed Kantian values (or NULL) will be enforced at the **application level**.
6. **Conditional Relationship Property Validation**: Similarly, the rule requiring `spatial_unit` when `distance` is present on `SPATIALLY_RELATES_TO` relationships cannot be enforced via standard constraints and will also be handled at the **application level**.
7. **API Path Structure (Phase 1):** Decided to use `/api/v1/concepts` and `/api/v1/relationships` as base paths for Understanding Module creation/retrieval endpoints. Concept-specific relationship queries remain under `/api/v1/concepts/{id}/...`.
8. **LLM Provider Selection**: Still evaluating options between OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source alternatives
9. **Deployment Strategy**: Deciding between cloud providers and on-premises deployment
10. **Validation Implementation Strategy**: Decided to implement validation as a centralized service (`KantianValidator`). **Confirmed working via integration tests for API endpoints.**

## Current Challenges

1. **Query Optimization**: Ensuring efficient performance for complex graph queries
2. **Concept Classification**: Determining the right level of granularity for concept categorization
3. **Relationship Constraints**: Implementing proper constraints to maintain data integrity across relationship types
4. **Integration Strategy**: Planning the connection between the Knowledge Graph and other modules
5. **Modality Migration Complexity**: Ensuring a smooth and accurate migration from property-based to judgment-based modality in Phase 2.
6. **Application-Level Validation Consistency**: Ensuring rigorous and consistent validation logic is applied across all application components writing `quality` and `modality` properties to the database, **as well as conditional properties like `spatial_unit`**.
7. **Testing Approach**: Developing comprehensive tests for graph operations and constraints
