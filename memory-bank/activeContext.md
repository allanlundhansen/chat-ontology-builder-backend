# Active Context - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: (Current Date)*

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus remains on implementing the foundational **Phase 1** requirements outlined in `01-Kantian-Category-Structure-KG.md`. Specifically, we are building out the **API layer** using FastAPI and ensuring interactions with the Neo4j database are correct and tested.

### API Layer
- **Concepts Endpoint (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested (basic creation, validation).
  - `GET /`: Implemented and tested (retrieval with filtering).
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested (retrieval by ID, 404 handling).
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested (deletion by ID, 404/204 handling).
  - `PUT / PATCH /{element_id}`: **Next Up**
- **Relationships Endpoint (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested (basic creation, spatial unit validation).
  - `GET /`: Not started.
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Not started.
  - `PUT / PATCH /{element_id}`: Not started.
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: Not started.
- **Categories Endpoint (`/api/v1/categories`)**: Not started.

### Database Layer (Neo4j)
- Core schema based on Kantian categories exists.
- Queries for creating concepts and relationships are implemented within API endpoints.
- Queries for retrieving concepts (all and by ID) are implemented.
- Queries for deleting concepts are implemented.
- Indexing is partially implemented.

### Testing
- Integration tests for `POST /concepts`, `GET /concepts`, `GET /concepts/{id}`, `DELETE /concepts/{id}`, and `POST /relationships` are implemented and passing.
- Unit tests for specific validation logic exist.
- Test fixtures for Neo4j sessions (async) are set up.
- Specific test failures related to fixtures, assertions, and async loops have been resolved.

## Recent Changes

- **Implemented `DELETE /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to delete a concept by its element ID using `DETACH DELETE`. Handles 404 for non-existent IDs and returns 204 on success. Added integration tests (`test_delete_concept_success`, `test_delete_concept_not_found`). Fixed issues related to response key (`elementId`) and exception handling (`except Exception` catching `HTTPException`).
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/concepts` Endpoint**: Added functionality to retrieve a list of concepts, including filtering by `limit` and `confidence_threshold`. Added integration tests.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to retrieve a single concept by its element ID. Implemented 404 handling for non-existent IDs. Added integration tests.
- **Resolved Test Failures**: Addressed `FixtureLookupError`, multiple `AssertionErrors` (`confidence_score` vs `confidence`, `201` vs `200`), and `RuntimeError` (async loop conflict).
- **Updated Documentation**: Reflected implementation progress in `01-Kantian-Category-Structure-KG.md`. Introduced `docs/current_tasks.md` for granular task tracking and `docs/icebox.md` for deferred tasks.

## Open Questions & Decisions

- **UPDATE Method**: Decide between `PUT` (replace) vs. `PATCH` (partial update) for concept and relationship modifications. `PATCH` is generally preferred for flexibility.
- **Skipped Tests**: Prioritize addressing skipped tests? (e.g., tests requiring specific known element IDs, `test_list_concepts_empty`).
- **Error Handling**: Refine error handling and response formats for consistency.
- **INSTANCE_OF Relationship**: How should the `INSTANCE_OF` relationship (Task 2/3 in PRD) be managed via the API? Likely needs dedicated endpoints or specific handling within concept/category endpoints.
- **API Naming Convention**: Task created in `icebox.md` to enforce consistent `snake_case` in JSON responses.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1.  **Commit Changes**: Commit the implemented DELETE endpoint, tests, and documentation updates (`current_tasks.md`, `icebox.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2.  **Decide Next API Task**: Choose between implementing Concept `UPDATE`, addressing skipped tests, moving to Relationship CRUD, or addressing an `icebox.md` item.

### API Layer
- Implement `UPDATE` (`PUT`/`PATCH`) endpoint for concepts.
- Implement `GET`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` endpoints for relationships.
- Implement endpoints for categories.

### Database Layer
- Implement Cypher queries for update operations.
- Implement queries for managing `INSTANCE_OF` relationships.
- Develop queries for navigating semantic, temporal, and spatial relationships as per PRD Task 4.

### Testing
- Add integration tests for `UPDATE` endpoints for concepts and remaining CRUD for relationships/categories.
- Address skipped tests.
- Potentially add more unit tests for complex business logic if needed.

### Documentation
- Continue updating Memory Bank files as progress is made.
- Generate/update OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.
- Document schema and queries more formally (PRD Task 5).
- Address items in `icebox.md` when prioritized.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Direct Neo4j Implementation**: Decided to implement the Knowledge Graph directly in Neo4j with Cypher scripts rather than using a Python abstraction layer to minimize unnecessary complexity
2. **Cypher Query Approach**: Chose to use direct Cypher queries instead of GraphQL, focusing on leveraging Neo4j's native query capabilities
3. **Query Templates**: Decided to define reusable query templates in `.cypher` files. These will be loaded and executed by the application layer, as APOC procedures (`apoc.custom.asProcedure`) are not available in the current AuraDB environment.
4. **Modality Representation Strategy**: Decided to replace the Phase 1 property-based modality on Concept nodes with a judgment-based representation in Phase 2, rather than maintaining coexistence. This involves a planned migration.
5. **Quality/Modality Value Validation**: Due to limitations with Neo4j 5.x constraint syntax and the unavailability of APOC triggers in the current AuraDB environment, the validation ensuring `quality` and `modality` properties contain only the allowed Kantian values (or NULL) will be enforced at the **application level**.
6. **Conditional Relationship Property Validation**: Similarly, the rule requiring `spatial_unit` when `distance` is present on `SPATIALLY_RELATES_TO` relationships cannot be enforced via standard constraints and will also be handled at the **application level**.
7. **API Path Structure (Phase 1):** Decided to use `/api/v1/concepts` and `/api/v1/relationships` as base paths for Understanding Module creation/retrieval endpoints. Concept-specific relationship queries remain under `/api/v1/concepts/{id}/...`.
8. **LLM Provider Selection**: Still evaluating options between OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source alternatives
9. **Deployment Strategy**: Deciding between cloud providers and on-premises deployment
10. **Validation Implementation Strategy**: Decided to implement validation as a centralized service (`KantianValidator`). **Confirmed working via integration tests for API endpoints.**

## Current Challenges

1. **Query Optimization**: Ensuring efficient performance for complex graph queries
2. **Concept Classification**: Determining the right level of granularity for concept categorization
3. **Relationship Constraints**: Implementing proper constraints/validation for all relationship types (Spatial done).
4. **Integration Strategy**: Planning the connection between the Knowledge Graph and other modules
5. **Modality Migration Complexity**: Ensuring a smooth and accurate migration from property-based to judgment-based modality in Phase 2.
6. **Application-Level Validation Consistency**: Validation implemented and tested via API; need to ensure consistency if other data entry points are added later. **(Risk Mitigated for API)**
7. **Testing Approach**: Initial validation tests successful; need broader coverage (success cases, other relationship types, read/update/delete operations).

## Current Challenges

1. **Query Optimization**: Ensuring efficient performance for complex graph queries
2. **Concept Classification**: Determining the right level of granularity for concept categorization
3. **Relationship Constraints**: Implementing proper constraints to maintain data integrity across relationship types
4. **Integration Strategy**: Planning the connection between the Knowledge Graph and other modules
5. **Modality Migration Complexity**: Ensuring a smooth and accurate migration from property-based to judgment-based modality in Phase 2.
6. **Application-Level Validation Consistency**: Ensuring rigorous and consistent validation logic is applied across all application components writing `quality` and `modality` properties to the database, **as well as conditional properties like `spatial_unit`**.
7. **Testing Approach**: Developing comprehensive tests for graph operations and constraints
