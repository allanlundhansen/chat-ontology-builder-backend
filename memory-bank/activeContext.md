# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are in the initial phase of developing the KantAI Backend. The current focus is on:

1. **Project Setup**: Establishing the core infrastructure and development environment
2. **Architecture Design**: Refining the modular architecture based on Kantian principles
3. **Core Module Implementation**: Implementing the fundamental modules (Understanding, Imagination, Judgment)
4. **Knowledge Graph Structure**: Designing the Neo4j schema according to Kant's categorical framework
5. **LLM Integration**: Setting up the Action/Sense Layer for processing external data

## Recent Changes

No implementation has been completed yet. The project is in the planning and design phase.

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up development environment with Python, Neo4j, and Docker
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Establish code quality standards and automated checks

2. **Core Module Implementation**:
   - Begin implementing the Understanding Module with Neo4j
   - Define SHACL constraints for the knowledge graph
   - Set up the basic structure for the Imagination Module
   - Implement the Judgment Module for classification

3. **API Development**:
   - Design and implement FastAPI endpoints for core functionality
   - Set up WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Implement authentication and authorization

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Set up connections to external LLM providers
   - Implement local LLM deployment for development
   - Develop the Action/Sense Layer for data ingestion

5. **Knowledge Graph**:
   - Implement Kant's categorical structure in Neo4j
   - Define relationship types and constraints
   - Set up initial seed data for testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **LLM Provider Selection**: Evaluating options between OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source alternatives
2. **Neo4j Schema Design**: Determining the optimal graph structure for representing Kantian categories
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Deciding between cloud providers and on-premises deployment
4. **Testing Approach**: Developing specialized tests for evaluating cognitive capabilities
5. **Integration Strategy**: Planning the integration with the Chat Ontology Builder frontend

## Current Challenges

1. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Designing effective bridging mechanisms between neural and symbolic representations
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient graph operations in Neo4j for complex queries
3. **LLM Reliability**: Addressing hallucination and inconsistency issues in LLM outputs
4. **Concept Formation**: Implementing reflective judgment for dynamic concept creation
5. **Ethical Framework**: Translating Kantian deontological ethics into computational constraints
