# Active Context - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: 2024-08-06*

## Current Work Focus

Focus is shifting towards addressing remaining skipped tests, particularly within `test_concepts.py`, after successfully refactoring and fixing two previously skipped tests: `test_get_concept_properties` and `test_get_causal_chain`. All core CRUD API functionality is complete, and previous test warnings have been resolved.

### API Layer
- **Concepts Endpoint (`/api/v1/concepts`)**: Fully Implemented (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Relationships Endpoint (`/api/v1/relationships`)**: Fully Implemented (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Categories Endpoint (`/api/v1/categories`)**: Retrieval Implemented (GET /, GET /{name}). Modification endpoints (POST, PATCH, DELETE) intentionally skipped for Phase 1.

### Database Layer (Neo4j)
- Core schema based on Kantian categories exists.
- Queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on concepts are implemented.
- Query for creating relationships implemented.
- Query for listing relationships (with pagination/filtering) implemented.
- Queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on relationships are implemented.
- Indexing is partially implemented.

### Testing
- Integration tests for Concept CRUD (`POST`, `GET /`, `GET /{id}`, `DELETE /{id}`, `PATCH /{id}`) are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for `POST /relationships` are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for `GET /relationships` (listing, filtering, pagination) are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for Relationship CRUD (`POST`, `GET /`, `GET /{id}`, `PATCH /{id}`, `DELETE /{id}`) are implemented and passing.
- Unit tests for specific validation logic exist.
- Test fixtures for Neo4j sessions (async) are set up and `conftest.py` path issues resolved.
- Test warnings previously identified have been resolved.

## Recent Changes

- **Refactored `test_get_concept_properties`**: Updated test to create its own data ('Ball', 'TestRedProp' concepts, 'HAS_PROPERTY' relationship) using `async_client` and the `clear_db_before_test` fixture, removing reliance on the old `get_id` helper and `KNOWN_IDS`. The test now passes.
- **Refactored `test_get_causal_chain`**: Successfully refactored the test to create its own data ('TestHeat', 'TestExpansion', 'TestMelting' concepts and 'CAUSES' relationships) and assert the `List[PathResponse]` structure. This involved several steps:
    - Adding `@pytest.mark.usefixtures("clear_db_before_test")`.
    - Iteratively debugging and fixing the `GET_CAUSAL_CHAIN` Cypher query in `src/cypher_queries/specialized_queries.py`:
        - Escaping literal curly braces (`{{`, `}}`) to resolve `IndexError` with `.format()`.
        - Ensuring the projection returned `type`, `start_node_id`, `end_node_id` (snake_case), and `properties` for relationships to match the `Relationship` Pydantic model and fix validation errors.
    - Updating the `get_causal_chain` endpoint in `src/api/v1/endpoints/concepts.py` to correctly process the new query structure and validate against `PathResponse`.
    - Modifying the test assertions in `tests/api/v1/test_concepts.py` to:
        - Expect a `List[PathResponse]`.
        - Check for the presence of 'nodes' and 'relationships' keys.
        - Correctly look up start/end node names using `start_node_id` and `end_node_id`.
    - The test now passes reliably.
- **Resolved Neo4j `UserWarning: Expected a result with a single record...`**: Resolved by fixing Cypher direction (`-[r]-` to `-[r]->`) and adding explicit result count checks.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/relationships/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added retrieval and tests.
- **Fixed `PATCH /api/v1/relationships/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Resolved datetime serialization and property issues.
- **Refactored Concept Queries**: Moved to Python constants, removed `cypher_loader.py`.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/relationships/` Endpoint**: Added listing with filtering/pagination.
- **Implemented `PATCH /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added partial updates.
- **Implemented `DELETE /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added deletion.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/concepts` & `GET /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoints**: Added retrieval.

## Open Questions & Decisions

- **Skipped Tests**: Identify and address the *next* skipped test. (High Priority).
- **Error Handling**: Refine error handling and response formats for consistency across endpoints. (Medium Priority).
- **INSTANCE_OF Relationship**: How should this be managed via the API? (Low Priority).
- **API Naming Convention**: Task created in `icebox.md` to enforce consistent `snake_case` in JSON responses. Current endpoints return `elementId`. (Low Priority).
- **Category API Scope**: Confirmed that only GET endpoints are needed for Phase 1 due to the fixed nature of the Kantian categories.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Commit Changes**: Commit the successful refactoring of `test_get_concept_properties`, `test_get_causal_chain`, associated query/endpoint changes, and documentation updates.
2. **Identify Next Skipped Test**: Examine `tests/api/v1/test_concepts.py` (or other test files) for the next skipped test (marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` or similar).
3. **Plan Refactoring**: Analyze the chosen skipped test and plan its refactoring, likely following the pattern of creating necessary data within the test.

### API Layer
- No further API endpoint implementation planned for Phase 1.

### Database Layer
- Implement Cypher queries for Relationship `
