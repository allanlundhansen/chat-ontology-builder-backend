# Active Context - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: 2024-08-05*

## Current Work Focus

Focus is now shifting towards testing refinement and final cleanup for Phase 1 API work, as all planned CRUD functionality for Concepts and Relationships is complete, and Category modification endpoints have been intentionally omitted.

### API Layer
- **Concepts Endpoint (`/api/v1/concepts`)**: Fully Implemented (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Relationships Endpoint (`/api/v1/relationships`)**: Fully Implemented (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Categories Endpoint (`/api/v1/categories`)**: Retrieval Implemented (GET /, GET /{name}). Modification endpoints (POST, PATCH, DELETE) intentionally skipped for Phase 1.

### Database Layer (Neo4j)
- Core schema based on Kantian categories exists.
- Queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete, Update) on concepts are implemented.
- Query for creating relationships implemented.
- Query for listing relationships (with pagination/filtering) implemented.
- Indexing is partially implemented.

### Testing
- Integration tests for Concept CRUD (`POST`, `GET /`, `GET /{id}`, `DELETE /{id}`, `PATCH /{id}`) are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for `POST /relationships` are implemented and passing.
- Integration tests for `GET /relationships` (listing, filtering, pagination) are implemented and passing.
- Unit tests for specific validation logic exist.
- Test fixtures for Neo4j sessions (async) are set up and `conftest.py` path issues resolved.

## Recent Changes

- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/relationships/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to retrieve a single relationship by its `element_id`. Handled 404 cases. Added integration tests (`test_get_relationship_by_id_success`, `test_get_relationship_by_id_not_found`). Debugged and resolved multiple issues including parameter ordering `SyntaxError`, missing `fastapi.Path` and `neo4j.AsyncDriver` imports, `neo4j_driver` dependency injection, Pydantic validation errors (`KeyError: 'element_id'`), query alias mismatches (`source_node_id` vs `source_id`), and test assertion mismatches.
- **Fixed `PATCH /api/v1/relationships/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Resolved issues related to `neo4j.time.DateTime` serialization errors. Renamed `creation_timestamp` to `created_at` in the `RelationshipProperties` model and added `updated_at`. Modified the endpoint logic to explicitly convert Neo4j datetime objects before validation and response. Updated tests (`test_update_relationship_properties_success`) which are now passing.
- **Refactored Concept Queries**: Moved core Concept CRUD queries from `query_templates.cypher` to Python constants in `src/cypher_queries/concept_queries.py` to resolve issues with the `cypher_loader` (caching, potential parsing issues). Updated `src/api/v1/endpoints/concepts.py` to use these constants.
- **Temporarily Disabled Query Cache**: Commented out `@lru_cache` in `src/utils/cypher_loader.py` during debugging.
- **Achieved Passing Test Suite**: After the above fixes, the full test suite (`poetry run pytest`) now passes (85 passed, 9 skipped, 7 warnings).
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/relationships/` Endpoint**: Added functionality to list relationships with optional type filtering and pagination (`skip`, `limit`). Updated `RelationshipResponse` and `RelationshipListResponse` models to include `element_id` and support the list structure. Refactored Cypher query for listing.
- **Resolved Relationship Creation/Listing Issues**: Debugged and fixed multiple issues:
    - Switched from APOC to standard Cypher `MATCH` and `CREATE` for relationship creation.
    - Implemented dynamic relationship type creation using f-strings.
    - Correctly handled asynchronous operations (`await` keyword).
    - Ensured `element_id` is returned by the creation query.
    - Added `creation_timestamp` and filtered `None` properties before `SET`.
    - Updated Pydantic models (`RelationshipResponse`) to include `element_id`.
    - Updated test assertions to match the `RelationshipListResponse` structure and use `element_id`.
    - Ensured pagination test (`test_list_relationships_pagination`) uses `clear_db_before_test` fixture and type filtering for reliable results.
- **Implemented `PATCH /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to partially update a concept. Uses `ConceptUpdate` model with optional fields and `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`. Uses `SET c += $update_data` Cypher clause. Returns updated concept. Handles 404 and 200 responses. Added integration tests (`test_update_concept_partial_success`, `test_update_concept_not_found`). Debugged and fixed issues related to `elementId`/`element_id` key consistency between Cypher, Pydantic models, and dictionary creation.
- **Resolved Test Setup Issues**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` by correcting `sys.path` in `conftest.py` and removing faulty enum imports from `models/concept.py`. Fixed `NameError` for `PROJECT_ROOT` in `conftest.py`.
- **Implemented `DELETE /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoint**: Added functionality to delete a concept. Added integration tests.
- **Implemented `GET /api/v1/concepts` & `GET /api/v1/concepts/{element_id}` Endpoints**: Added retrieval functionality with tests.
- **Resolved Previous Test Failures**: Addressed `FixtureLookupError`, multiple `AssertionErrors`, and `RuntimeError`.
- **Updated Documentation**: Introduced `docs/current_tasks.md`, `docs/icebox.md`, `docs/done_tasks.md` for task tracking.
- **Deprecated Cypher Loader**: Added deprecation notice to `src/utils/cypher_loader.py` as it's no longer needed now that all queries are Python constants. **The file `cypher_loader.py` has now been deleted.**
- **Clarified Category API Scope**: Explicitly decided to omit `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints for categories in Phase 1, as the Kantian structure is fixed. Updated `current_tasks.md` accordingly.

## Open Questions & Decisions

- **Skipped Tests**: Prioritize addressing skipped tests? (e.g., tests requiring specific known element IDs, `test_list_concepts_empty`).
- **Error Handling**: Refine error handling and response formats for consistency across endpoints.
- **INSTANCE_OF Relationship**: How should this be managed via the API?
- **API Naming Convention**: Task created in `icebox.md` to enforce consistent `snake_case` in JSON responses. Current endpoints return `elementId`.
- **Category API Scope**: Confirmed that only GET endpoints are needed for Phase 1 due to the fixed nature of the Kantian categories.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Review Documentation**: Ensure all relevant memory bank and docs files are updated to reflect the current state.
2. **Commit Changes**: Commit the successful query refactoring, tests, and documentation updates.
3. **Decide Next Focus Area**:
   * Address test **warnings** (Pytest mark, Neo4j multi-record UserWarning).
   * Address **skipped tests** (mostly in `test_concepts.py`).
   * Perform final code review/cleanup for Phase 1 API.

### API Layer
- No further API endpoint implementation planned for Phase 1.

### Database Layer
- Implement Cypher queries for Relationship `

## Active Decisions and Considerations

11. **Category API Scope (Phase 1)**: Decided to only implement GET endpoints (`GET /`, `GET /{name}`) for categories in Phase 1. POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations are omitted as the Kantian category structure is pre-defined and fixed, making modification via API inconsistent with the model's philosophy.
