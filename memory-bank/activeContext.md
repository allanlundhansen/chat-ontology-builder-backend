# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have begun implementation of the KantAI Backend, with current focus on:

1. **Understanding Module Implementation**: 
   - ✅ Implemented Neo4j schema for the Kantian Category Structure Knowledge Graph
   - ✅ Created concept node structure with properties and constraints
   - ✅ Defined relationship types based on Kantian categories
   - ✅ Developed query templates for common operations
   - ✅ Created sample data for testing and demonstration
   - ✅ Implemented validation queries to ensure correctness
   - Next: Developing API layer for external access (Note: API design should anticipate Phase 2 modality transition and include application-level validation for `quality`/`modality` properties **and the conditional `spatial_unit` requirement on `SPATIALLY_RELATES_TO` relationships**)

2. **Architecture Implementation**: Establishing the initial framework based on Kantian principles
   - Next modules to implement: General Logic Module and SHACL Constraints

3. **Development Environment**: Setting up the core development infrastructure
   - ✅ Created basic directory structure for implementation
   - ✅ Established pattern for direct Neo4j/Cypher implementation
   - Next: Setting up containerization and CI/CD

4. **API Design**: Planning the service interfaces
   - Next: Implementing RESTful API endpoints for the Knowledge Graph

## Recent Changes

- Created Neo4j database schema for the Kantian Category Structure
- Implemented all four Kantian categories (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Modality) with subcategories
- Defined concept structure with properties, constraints, and indices
- Implemented relationship types corresponding to Kantian categories
- Created query templates (Cypher scripts) for common operations (Note: APOC custom procedures like `apoc.custom.asProcedure` are unavailable in the current environment, so templates will be executed by the application layer).
- Developed sample data and validation queries

## Next Steps

1. **Understanding Module API Layer**:
   - Create FastAPI endpoints for knowledge graph operations
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Develop Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

2. **SHACL Constraints Implementation**:
   - Implement SHACL constraints to enforce Kantian categorical rules
   - Create validation mechanisms for data integrity
   - Develop test suite for constraint validation

3. **General Logic Module**:
   - Implement Evans' input/output logic formalism
   - Create representation of judgment forms
   - Build connection with the Understanding Module
   - Plan for modality migration (property-based to judgment-based) as part of Phase 2

4. **Action/Sense Layer**:
   - Implement connection to LLM providers
   - Develop concept extraction pipeline
   - Create integration with Knowledge Graph

5. **Development Infrastructure**:
   - Set up Docker containers for Neo4j and backend services
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Create monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Direct Neo4j Implementation**: Decided to implement the Knowledge Graph directly in Neo4j with Cypher scripts rather than using a Python abstraction layer to minimize unnecessary complexity
2. **Cypher Query Approach**: Chose to use direct Cypher queries instead of GraphQL, focusing on leveraging Neo4j's native query capabilities
3. **Query Templates**: Decided to define reusable query templates in `.cypher` files. These will be loaded and executed by the application layer, as APOC procedures (`apoc.custom.asProcedure`) are not available in the current AuraDB environment.
4. **Modality Representation Strategy**: Decided to replace the Phase 1 property-based modality on Concept nodes with a judgment-based representation in Phase 2, rather than maintaining coexistence. This involves a planned migration.
5. **Quality/Modality Value Validation**: Due to limitations with Neo4j 5.x constraint syntax and the unavailability of APOC triggers in the current AuraDB environment, the validation ensuring `quality` and `modality` properties contain only the allowed Kantian values (or NULL) will be enforced at the **application level**.
6. **Conditional Relationship Property Validation**: Similarly, the rule requiring `spatial_unit` when `distance` is present on `SPATIALLY_RELATES_TO` relationships cannot be enforced via standard constraints and will also be handled at the **application level**.
7. **LLM Provider Selection**: Still evaluating options between OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source alternatives
8. **Deployment Strategy**: Deciding between cloud providers and on-premises deployment

## Current Challenges

1. **Query Optimization**: Ensuring efficient performance for complex graph queries
2. **Concept Classification**: Determining the right level of granularity for concept categorization
3. **Relationship Constraints**: Implementing proper constraints to maintain data integrity across relationship types
4. **Integration Strategy**: Planning the connection between the Knowledge Graph and other modules
5. **Modality Migration Complexity**: Ensuring a smooth and accurate migration from property-based to judgment-based modality in Phase 2.
6. **Application-Level Validation Consistency**: Ensuring rigorous and consistent validation logic is applied across all application components writing `quality` and `modality` properties to the database, **as well as conditional properties like `spatial_unit`**.
7. **Testing Approach**: Developing comprehensive tests for graph operations and constraints
