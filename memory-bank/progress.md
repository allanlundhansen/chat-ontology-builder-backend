# Progress - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: (Current Date)*

## What Works

### Core Setup
- Project structure initialized (FastAPI, Poetry).
- Neo4j database connection established (via `neo4j_driver` utility).
- Asynchronous Neo4j driver configuration functional.
- Basic FastAPI application setup running.
- Logging configured.
- Environment variables (`.env`) loaded correctly via `conftest.py`.
- Task tracking files (`docs/current_tasks.md`, `docs/icebox.md`, `docs/done_tasks.md`) established.
- Python path (`sys.path`) correctly configured in `conftest.py` for test discovery.

### API Layer
- **Concepts (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `PATCH /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested (partial updates).
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested (basic creation, spatial validation).

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for Concept CRUD (Create, Read - list/detail, Update - partial, Delete) are functional within API endpoints.
- Cypher query for creating relationships functional within API endpoint.
- Basic node structure for Concepts and Categories exists.
- Application-level validation for relationships (`spatial_unit`) exists.

### Testing
- Test environment setup (`pytest`, `anyio`, `httpx`).
- Async Neo4j test session fixtures functional.
- Prerequisite data fixtures functional.
- Integration tests for full Concept CRUD (`POST`, `GET /`, `GET /{id}`, `DELETE /{id}`, `PATCH /{id}`) are passing.
- Integration tests for `POST /relationships` passing.
- Previous test setup/failure issues (imports, `conftest.py`, assertions, async loops) resolved.

## What's Left to Build

### API Layer
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `GET /` (list relationships).
  - `GET /{element_id}` (get specific relationship).
  - `UPDATE` (`PUT` or `PATCH`) endpoint.
  - `DELETE` endpoint.
- **Categories (`/api/v1/categories`)**:
  - All CRUD endpoints.
- **Handling `INSTANCE_OF`**: Define API management.
- **Advanced Querying**: Expose via API.

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for Relationship `GET`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- Implementation of `INSTANCE_OF` relationship creation/management.
- Queries for advanced traversal.
- Finalize indexing strategy.

### Testing
- Integration tests for remaining Relationship CRUD & Category CRUD.
- Tests for `INSTANCE_OF` management.
- Tests for advanced query endpoints.
- Address skipped tests.

### Documentation & Other
- Address items in `icebox.md` (e.g., API Naming Convention).
- Full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation.
- Formal schema documentation (PRD Task 5).
- SHACL constraint implementation (Future phase).
- Integration with other modules (Future phases).

## Known Issues & Blockers

- **Skipped Tests**: Several tests skipped due to dependencies on specific element IDs or fixture conflicts. (Low Priority).
- **Philosophical Simplifications**: Quality/Modality as properties. See `Philosophical-Considerations-Category-Implementation.md`. (Ongoing awareness).
- **API Naming Convention**: Currently inconsistent (`camelCase` in some responses, e.g., `elementId`). Tracked in `icebox.md`. (Low Priority).
