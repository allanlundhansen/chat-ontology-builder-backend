# Progress

## Current Status

The KantAI Backend project is transitioning from the planning phase to initial implementation. The first component - the Kantian Category Structure Knowledge Graph - has been designed and implemented as the foundation for the Understanding Module.

## What Works

- Project conceptual architecture has been designed
- Theoretical mapping of Kantian concepts to computational components is complete
- Documentation of system requirements and goals is in place
- **Neo4j schema for the Kantian Category Structure has been implemented**, including:
  - Four primary Kantian categories (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Modality) with subcategories
  - Concept node structure with properties and constraints (**Note**: Value constraints for `quality`/`modality` enforced at application level)
  - Relationship types based on Kantian categories
  - Query templates (`.cypher` files) for common operations (Note: Not stored procedures due to platform limitations)
  - Sample data for testing and demonstration
  - Validation queries to ensure correctness (updated to reflect direct query execution)

## What's Left to Build

### Core Components (In Progress)
- Understanding Module (Neo4j GraphDB) - **Schema Implemented**
  - Integration with remaining backend services
  - API layer for external access
- Imagination Module (Productive and Reproductive) - Not Started
- Judgment Module (Determinant and Reflective) - Not Started
  - Includes plan for replacing property-based modality with judgment-based representation
  - Requires migration strategy for existing modality data
- Reason Module (Active Inference) - Not Started
- Action/Sense Layer (LLM Integration) - Not Started
- Ethical Oversight Module - Not Started

### Infrastructure (In Progress)
- Development environment setup - **Basic structure created**
- CI/CD pipeline - Not Started
- Containerization with Docker - Not Started
- Kubernetes deployment - Not Started
- Monitoring and logging - Not Started

### API Layer (Not Started)
- RESTful API endpoints
- WebSocket support
- Authentication and authorization
- Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Integration (Not Started)
- Connection with Chat Ontology Builder frontend
- External LLM provider integration
- Vector database integration

### Testing (In Progress)
- Unit tests for individual components - **Basic validation queries implemented for Neo4j schema**
- Integration tests for module interactions - Not Started
- Cognitive tests for reasoning capabilities - Not Started
- Performance and load testing - Not Started

## Known Issues

As the project is still in early implementation, there are a few known technical challenges:

1. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: The bidirectional translation between neural embeddings and symbolic representations requires careful design
2. **LLM Reliability**: Ensuring consistent and accurate outputs from LLMs will be challenging
3. **Graph Performance**: Neo4j query performance for complex operations needs optimization
4. **Concept Formation**: Implementing reflective judgment for novel inputs will require sophisticated algorithms
5. **Modality Migration**: The planned transition from property-based to judgment-based modality in Phase 2 introduces significant migration complexity.
6. **Data Integrity Risk (Quality/Modality)**: Lack of database-level constraints for `quality`/`modality` values (due to AuraDB limitations) requires strict application-level validation; risk of inconsistent data if validation is bypassed.
7. **Ethical Framework**: Translating Kantian ethics into computational constraints is conceptually challenging

## Next Milestones

1. **Understanding Module API Development** (Target: Immediate)
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for the Knowledge Graph
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Create documentation

2. **SHACL Constraints Implementation** (Target: Soon)
   - Add SHACL constraints to enforce Kantian categorical rules
   - Implement validation mechanisms
   - Create test suite for constraint validation

3. **Action/Sense Layer Integration** (Target: Soon)
   - Implement LLM integration for data ingestion
   - Create pipelines for extracting concepts from unstructured data
   - Connect to the Knowledge Graph

4. **General Logic Module Implementation** (Target: Soon)
   - Implement Evans' input/output logic formalism
   - Create the judgment forms representation
   - Connect with Understanding Module
