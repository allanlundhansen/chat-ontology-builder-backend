# Progress

## Current Status

The KantAI Backend project is currently in the **planning and design phase**. The conceptual architecture has been defined, but implementation has not yet begun.

## What Works

- Project conceptual architecture has been designed
- Theoretical mapping of Kantian concepts to computational components is complete
- Documentation of system requirements and goals is in place

## What's Left to Build

### Core Components (Not Started)
- Understanding Module (Neo4j GraphDB)
- Imagination Module (Productive and Reproductive)
- Judgment Module (Determinant and Reflective)
- Reason Module (Active Inference)
- Action/Sense Layer (LLM Integration)
- Ethical Oversight Module

### Infrastructure (Not Started)
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployment
- Monitoring and logging

### API Layer (Not Started)
- RESTful API endpoints
- WebSocket support
- GraphQL interface
- Authentication and authorization
- Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Integration (Not Started)
- Connection with Chat Ontology Builder frontend
- External LLM provider integration
- Vector database integration

### Testing (Not Started)
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Cognitive tests for reasoning capabilities
- Performance and load testing

## Known Issues

As the project is still in the planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, several technical challenges have been identified:

1. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: The bidirectional translation between neural embeddings and symbolic representations requires careful design
2. **LLM Reliability**: Ensuring consistent and accurate outputs from LLMs will be challenging
3. **Graph Performance**: Neo4j query performance for complex operations needs optimization
4. **Concept Formation**: Implementing reflective judgment for novel inputs will require sophisticated algorithms
5. **Ethical Framework**: Translating Kantian ethics into computational constraints is conceptually challenging

## Next Milestones

1. **Development Environment Setup** (Target: Immediate)
   - Repository creation
   - Development container configuration
   - Neo4j setup
   - Initial project structure

2. **Core Module Prototypes** (Target: Soon)

   - Simple Imagination Module with generative capabilities
   - Preliminary Judgment Module for classification

3. **Action/Sense Layer** (Target: Soon)
   - LLM integration for data ingestion
   - Basic preprocessing pipeline

4. **API Foundation** (Target: Soon)
   - Core FastAPI setup
   - Basic endpoint structure
   - Authentication framework
