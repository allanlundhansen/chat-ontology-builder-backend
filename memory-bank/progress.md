# Progress - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: (Current Date)*

## What Works

### Core Setup
- Project structure initialized (FastAPI, Poetry).
- Neo4j database connection established (via `neo4j_driver` utility).
- Asynchronous Neo4j driver configuration is functional.
- Basic FastAPI application setup is running.
- Logging is configured.
- Environment variables (`.env`) are used for configuration.

### API Layer
- **Concepts (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `POST /`: Endpoint implemented for creating concepts. Handles basic validation via Pydantic models (`ConceptCreate`, `ConceptResponse`). Returns created concept data.
  - `GET /`: Endpoint implemented for retrieving a list of concepts. Supports `limit` and `confidence_threshold` query parameters. Returns a list of concept data.
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Endpoint implemented for retrieving a single concept by its element ID. Returns concept data or 404 if not found.
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `POST /`: Endpoint implemented for creating relationships. Handles validation, including `spatial_unit` constraints. Returns created relationship data.

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for creating concepts and relationships (including spatial properties) are functional within the API endpoints.
- Cypher queries for retrieving concepts (all with filtering, and by element ID) are functional within the API endpoints.
- Basic node structure for Concepts and Categories exists.
- Constraints for `spatial_unit` on relationships are handled at the application level.

### Testing
- Test environment setup with `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`/`anyio`.
- Fixtures for asynchronous Neo4j test sessions (`neo4j_async_session`) are working.
- Fixtures for creating prerequisite data (e.g., `test_concepts_for_rels`) are functional (after async fix).
- Integration tests for `POST /concepts` are passing.
- Integration tests for `GET /concepts` (list view) are passing.
- Integration tests for `GET /concepts/{element_id}` (detail view, including 404) are passing.
- Integration tests for `POST /relationships` focusing on validation errors (e.g., missing/invalid `spatial_unit`) are passing.
- Test failures related to fixture lookups, assertion mismatches (`confidence` vs `confidence_score`), and async event loops have been identified and resolved.

## What's Left to Build

### API Layer
- **Concepts (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `UPDATE` (`PUT` or `PATCH`) endpoint.
  - `DELETE` endpoint.
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `GET /` (list relationships).
  - `GET /{element_id}` (get specific relationship).
  - `UPDATE` (`PUT` or `PATCH`) endpoint.
  - `DELETE` endpoint.
- **Categories (`/api/v1/categories`)**:
  - All CRUD endpoints.
- **Handling `INSTANCE_OF`**: Define how concepts are linked to Kantian subcategories (Quantity/Relation) via the API.
- **Advanced Querying**: Expose more complex graph traversal queries via API endpoints (PRD Task 4).

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on concepts and relationships.
- Implementation of `INSTANCE_OF` relationship creation/management.
- Queries for advanced traversal (causal, temporal, spatial, category-based).
- Finalize indexing strategy based on query patterns.

### Testing
- Integration tests for all remaining CRUD endpoints (Concepts, Relationships, Categories).
- Tests for `INSTANCE_OF` relationship management.
- Tests for advanced query endpoints.
- Address skipped tests (requires specific data setup or fixture refactoring).
- Potentially more unit tests for specific services or logic.

### Documentation & Other
- Full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation.
- Formal schema documentation (PRD Task 5).
- SHACL constraint implementation (Future phase).
- Integration with other modules (Logic Tensor Networks, General Logic) (Future phases).

## Known Issues & Blockers

- **Skipped Tests**: Several tests in `tests/api/v1/test_concepts.py` are skipped due to dependencies on specific, known element IDs or fixture conflicts (`test_list_concepts_empty`). Requires configuration or test data setup. (Low Priority for now).
- **Philosophical Simplifications**: The current representation of Quality/Modality as properties is a pragmatic simplification. See `Philosophical-Considerations-Category-Implementation.md`. (Ongoing awareness).

## Next Milestones

1. **Understanding Module API Development** (Target: Immediate)
   - Implement remaining RESTful API endpoints (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Create API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Add comprehensive API tests (success cases, edge cases)

2. **SHACL Constraints Implementation** (Target: Soon)
   - Add SHACL constraints to enforce Kantian categorical rules
   - Implement validation mechanisms
   - Create test suite for constraint validation

3. **Action/Sense Layer Integration** (Target: Soon)
   - Implement LLM integration for data ingestion
   - Create pipelines for extracting concepts from unstructured data
   - Connect to the Knowledge Graph

4. **General Logic Module Implementation** (Target: Soon)
   - Implement Evans' input/output logic formalism
   - Create the judgment forms representation
   - Connect with Understanding Module
