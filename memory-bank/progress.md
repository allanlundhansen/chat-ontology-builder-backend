# Progress - Project: KantAI Backend

*Last Updated: 2024-08-05*

## What Works

### Core Setup
- Project structure initialized (FastAPI, Poetry).
- Neo4j database connection established (via `neo4j_driver` utility).
- Asynchronous Neo4j driver configuration functional.
- Basic FastAPI application setup running.
- Logging configured.
- Environment variables (`.env`) loaded correctly via `conftest.py`.
- Task tracking files (`docs/current_tasks.md`, `docs/icebox.md`, `docs/done_tasks.md`) established.
- Python path (`sys.path`) correctly configured in `conftest.py` for test discovery.

### API Layer
- **Concepts (`/api/v1/concepts`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /`: Implemented and tested.
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `DELETE /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested.
  - `PATCH /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested (partial updates).
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `POST /`: Implemented and tested (basic creation, spatial validation, dynamic types).
  - `GET /`: Implemented and tested (listing, filtering, pagination).
  - `GET /{element_id}`: Implemented and tested (single relationship retrieval).
- **Categories (`/api/v1/categories`)**:
  - `GET /` endpoint implemented and tested.
  - `GET /{name}` endpoint implemented and tested.

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for Concept CRUD (Create, Read - list/detail, Update - partial, Delete) are functional within API endpoints.
- Cypher query for creating relationships functional within API endpoint.
- Cypher query for listing relationships (with filtering/pagination) functional within API endpoint.
- Cypher query for retrieving a single relationship by ID functional within API endpoint.
- Basic node structure for Concepts and Categories exists.
- Application-level validation for relationships (`spatial_unit`) exists.
- Integration tests for Relationship `POST /` and `GET /` endpoints passing.
- Integration tests for `GET /relationships/{element_id}` passing.
- Previous test setup/failure issues (imports, `conftest.py`, assertions, async loops) resolved.
- Resolved complex issues with relationship creation and listing, including dynamic types, `element_id` handling, property filtering, and test fixture conflicts.
- Resolved issues with GET relationship by ID endpoint (parameter order, imports, dependencies, query aliases, test assertions).
- Resolved issues with relationship updates (`PATCH`) regarding datetime serialization (`neo4j.time.DateTime`) and property consistency (`created_at`/`updated_at`).
- Concept CRUD queries refactored to Python constants (`src/cypher_queries/concept_queries.py`) removing reliance on `cypher_loader` for these core operations.
- Full test suite passing (85 passed, 9 skipped, 7 warnings) as of 2024-08-02.
- Removed deprecated `src/utils/cypher_loader.py` file.

## What's Left to Build

### API Layer
- **Relationships (`/api/v1/relationships`)**:
  - `UPDATE` (`PUT` or `PATCH`) endpoint.
  - `DELETE` endpoint.
- **Categories (`/api/v1/categories`)**:
  - No further endpoints planned for Phase 1 (POST/PATCH/DELETE intentionally skipped).
- **Handling `INSTANCE_OF`**: Define API management.
- **Advanced Querying**: Expose via API.

### Database Layer
- Cypher queries for Relationship `GET` (detail), `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- Cypher queries for Relationship `DELETE`.
- Implementation of `INSTANCE_OF` relationship creation/management.
- Queries for advanced traversal.
- Finalize indexing strategy.

### Testing
- Integration tests for remaining Relationship CRUD (`GET /{id}`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) & Category CRUD - **Scope Reduced**: Only GET endpoints are tested as POST/PATCH/DELETE were omitted.
- Integration tests for `INSTANCE_OF` management.
- Tests for advanced query endpoints.
- Address skipped tests.
- Address skipped tests and investigate warnings.

### Documentation & Other
- Address items in `icebox.md` (e.g., API Naming Convention).
- Full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation.
- Formal schema documentation (PRD Task 5).
- SHACL constraint implementation (Future phase).
- Integration with other modules (Future phases).

## Known Issues & Blockers

- **Skipped Tests**: Several tests skipped due to dependencies on specific element IDs or fixture conflicts. (Low Priority).
- **Philosophical Simplifications**: Quality/Modality as properties. See `Philosophical-Considerations-Category-Implementation.md`. (Ongoing awareness).
- **API Naming Convention**: Currently inconsistent (`camelCase` in some responses, e.g., `elementId`). Tracked in `icebox.md`. (Low Priority).
- **Test Warnings**: 7 warnings present in test output (Pytest mark, Neo4j UserWarning). Need investigation. (Medium Priority).
- **Deprecated Query Templates**: `query_templates.cypher` is now deprecated and marked as such. Consider complete removal in future release. (Low Priority).
- **Removed Query Loader**: The `cypher_loader.py` utility has been deleted as it's no longer necessary.
