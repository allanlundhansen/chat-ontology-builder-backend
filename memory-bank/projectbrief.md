# Project Brief: KantAI Backend

## Project Overview
The KantAI Backend is a Kantian-inspired neuro-symbolic AI framework implementing dynamic concept formation, adaptive reasoning, and structured knowledge representation. It serves as the core implementation of a cognitive architecture that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning, manages a knowledge graph based on Kantian principles, coordinates with LLMs, and provides a comprehensive API for frontend clients.

## Core Requirements

1. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Create a bidirectional translation system between neural embeddings and symbolic representations
2. **Dynamic Ontology Management**: Implement a self-updating knowledge graph based on Kant's categorical structure
3. **LLM-Powered Data Ingestion**: Develop a system that processes unstructured external data into structured concepts
4. **Ethical Reasoning**: Implement built-in deontological constraints throughout the decision-making process
5. **Active Inference**: Create a resource-aware computation system balancing information gain against computational cost
6. **Multi-stage Verification**: Develop robust hallucination detection and mitigation for LLM outputs
7. **Conversational Interface**: Implement natural language chat interaction with the knowledge graph
8. **Visual Knowledge Exploration**: Ensure integration with the Chat Ontology Builder for intuitive visualization

## Architecture

The backend implements five core cognitive modules:

1. **Understanding Module**: Neo4j GraphDB with SHACL constraints organizing knowledge according to Kant's categorical framework (with planned evolution for modality representation).
2. **Imagination Module**: Generative components bridging sensory data and concepts via productive and reproductive pathways
3. **Judgment Module**: Classification and concept formation through determinant and reflective judgment processes
4. **Reason Module**: Meta-reasoning layer ensuring global coherence through active inference
5. **Action/Sense Layer**: LLM-based ingestion converting external unstructured data into symbolic representations
6. **Chat Integration Service**: Dedicated interface enabling conversational interaction with the knowledge graph

## Primary Goals

1. Implement a robust, interpretable, and aligned AI system based on Kantian epistemology
2. Create a system capable of processing unstructured data into structured symbolic representations
3. Develop an architecture that ensures global coherence and ethical oversight in AI decision-making
4. Integrate seamlessly with the Chat Ontology Builder frontend
5. Provide comprehensive API endpoints for querying and manipulating the knowledge graph
